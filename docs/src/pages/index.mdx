Fuzzing implementations of cryptographic protocols is challenging.
In contrast to traditional fuzzing of file formats, cryptographic protocols require a
specific flow of cryptographic and mutually dependent messages to reach deep protocol states.
The specification of the TLS protocol describes sound flows of messages and cryptographic
operations.

Although the specification has been formally verified multiple times with significant
results, a gap has emerged from the fact that implementations of the same protocol have
not undergone the same logical analysis.
Because the development of cryptographic protocols is error-prone, multiple security
vulnerabilities have already been discovered in implementations in TLS which are not
present in its specification.

Inspired by symbolic protocol verification, we present a reference implementation of a
fuzzer named tlspuffin which employs a concrete semantic to execute TLS 1.2 and 1.3 symbolic traces.
In fact attacks which mix TLS versions are in scope of this implementation.
This method allows us to utilize a genetic fuzzing algorithm to fuzz protocol flows,
which is described by the following three stages.

* By mutating traces we can deviate from the specification to test logical flaws.
* Selection of interesting protocol flows advance the fuzzing procedure.
* A security violation oracle supervises executions for the absence of vulnerabilities.

The novel approach allows rediscovering known vulnerabilities, which are out-of-scope for
classical bit-level fuzzers. This proves that it is capable of reaching critical protocol
states.
In contrast to the promising methodology no new vulnerabilities were found by tlspuffin.
This can can be explained by the fact that the implementation effort of TLS protocol
primitives and extensions is high and not all features of the specification have been
implemented.
Nonetheless, the innovating approach is promising in terms of quickly reaching high edge
coverage, expressiveness of executable protocol traces and stable and extensible implementation.

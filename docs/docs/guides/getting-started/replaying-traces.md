title: 'Replaying Traces'
---

*tlspuffin* creates fuzzing inputs using high-level protocol abstractions.
Such an input is a *trace* of the messages send to the different *agents*.
Unlike standard fuzzers that can simply submit the generated inputs to the program under tests, executing a trace is a more involved process including:
- spawning the network agents involved in the trace
- building protocol messages
- transferring messages to agents
- reading and parsing the outputs generated by the agents

Therefore, *tlspuffin* provides the ability to stores all these steps in a `.trace` file and execute them on-demand.

## Executing a Trace

Through the *tlspuffin* CLI, the `execute` command provides a simple way to execute a trace:
```sh
./target/debug/tlspuffin execute 'seeds/tlspuffin::tls::seeds::seed_successful.trace'
```

:::note[Trace Validity]

Not all traces are *valid* traces in the sense of the protocol under test.
In particular, while fuzzing it is likely to generate invalid traces due to malformed or out-of-oder messages.
When trying to execute an invalid trace, the `execute` command will signal whether the execution finished successfully and provide some hints about the error encountered in case of failure.

## Replaying Against a Real Entity

While it is useful to let *tlspuffin* spawn the agents involved in a trace, the communication between these agents is made through a harness interface wrapping the library under test.
Using the CLI `tcp` command, it is also possible to replace the first agent of a trace with a real entity connected through TCP.

For example, one could start an OpenSSL server on port 44410:
```sh
openssl s_server -key tlspuffin/assets/alice-key.pem -cert tlspuffin/assets/alice.pem -accept 44410
```

And replay one of the seed trace against this server:
```sh
./target/debug/tlspuffin tcp --port 44410 'seeds/tlspuffin::tls::seeds::seed_client_attacker_full.trace'
```

# Enables features which are neccassary to make openssl ready for fuzzing, somehow I'm ont able to patch these in,

default = [ ]
# Enables compilation of some older algorithms: md2 (hash), rc5 (block cypher) and enabled use of
# some weaker algorithms in SSL connections. These are generally not recommended for use.
weak-crypto = []
# Enables compilation of the Camellia symmetric key block cypher. Since hardware acceleration for
# it is not available on most systems, this is not as used as AES.

# Enables compilation of International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), a symmetric key block
# cypher sometimes used as an AES128 alternative.

# Enables compilation of SEED, a symmetric key block cypher mostly used in South Korea, but
# otherwise not widely supported.

window.SIDEBAR_ITEMS = {"enum":[["Action","There are two action types [`OutputAction`] and [`InputAction`] differ. Both actions drive the internal state machine of an [`Agent`] forward by calling `next_state()`. The [`OutputAction`] first forwards the state machine and then extracts knowledge from the TLS messages produced by the underlying stream by calling  `take_message_from_outbound(...)`. The [`InputAction`] evaluates the recipe term and injects the newly produced message into the inbound channel of the [`Agent`] referenced through the corresponding [`Step`]s by calling `add_to_inbound(...)` and then drives the state machine forward. Therefore, the difference is that one step increases the knowledge of the attacker, whereas the other action uses the available knowledge."]],"struct":[["InputAction","The [`InputAction`] evaluates the recipe term and injects the newly produced message into the inbound channel of the [`Agent`] referenced through the corresponding [`Step`]s by calling `add_to_inbound(...)` and then drives the state machine forward."],["Knowledge","[Knowledge] describes an atomic piece of knowledge inferred by the [`crate::variable_data::extract_knowledge`] function [Knowledge] is made of the data, the agent that produced the output, the TLS message type and the internal type."],["OutputAction","The [`OutputAction`] first forwards the state machine and then extracts knowledge from the TLS messages produced by the underlying stream by calling  `take_message_from_outbound(...)`.

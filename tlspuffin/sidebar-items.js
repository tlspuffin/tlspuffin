The module offers a variety of [`DynamicFunction`]s which can be used in the fuzzing."],["trace","This module contains [`Trace`]s consisting of several [`Step`]s, of which each has either an [`OutputAction`] or [`InputAction`]. This is a declarative way of modeling communication between [`Agent`]s.

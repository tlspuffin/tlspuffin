//! fork. Upstreaming this fork is becoming unfeasible and there are not benefits in keeping up
//! with the latest version of rustls. If we want to support fuzzing new features of upcomping TLS
//! versions then we have to manually integrate them.
//!
//! This module contains primitives required to perform TLS 1.2 and 1.3 handshakes.

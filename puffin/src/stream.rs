//! The communication streams between [`Agent`](crate::agent::Agent)s.
//!
//! These are currently implemented by using an in-memory buffer.
//!
//! One might ask why we want two channels. There two very practical reasons
//! for this. Note that these are advantages for the implementation and are not
//! strictly required from a theoretical point of view.
//!
//! * Having two buffers resembles how networking works in reality: Each computer has an input and
//!   an output buffer. In case of TCP the input buffer can become full and therefore the
//!   transmission is throttled.
//! * It is beneficial to model each agent with two buffers according to the Single-responsibility
//!   principle. When sending or receiving data each agent only has to look at its own two buffer.
//!   If each agent had only one buffer, then you would need to read from another agent which has
//!   the data you want. Or if you design it the other way around you would need to write to the
//!   buffer of the agent to which you want to send data.
//!
//! The [`Agent`](crate::agent::Agent) Alice can add data to the *inbound channel* of Bob.
//! Bob can then read the data from his *inbound channel* and put data in his *outbound channel*.
//! If Bob is an [`Agent`](crate::agent::Agent), which has an underlying *PUT state* then OpenSSL
//! may write into the *outbound channel* of Bob.
